pressureNET-SDK-Example
===========================

This is an example Android app that demonstrates how to use the [pressureNET SDK](https://github.com/Cbsoftware/pressureNET-SDK). The [pressureNET](https://github.com/Cbsoftware/pressureNET) project is an open source effort to crowdsource live atmosphere data from sensors in Android phones. The data is sent directly to researchers to help us improve weather forecast accuracy.

The pressureNET SDK integrates into any existing Android project (with minimal modifications) and will collect atmosphere data from sensors in the background. The SDK also provides simple access to our Live Data API, which contains all of our crowdsourced measurements from all users. Since the SDK offers a significant feature set, this example project explains and demos only the most common. Full documentation for the SDK can be found in the [SDK project.](https://github.com/Cbsoftware/pressureNET-SDK).
